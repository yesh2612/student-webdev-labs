### Accessibility
01-HTML Lab Exercise

I have used <label>, This <lable> elements are used to provide a textual description for each input field. <fieldset> and <legend> these elements are used to group related items within the form, especially the radio buttons and checkboxes. I have used "placeholder"
in the input fields for name and email, which can be helpful for understanding what is expected in those fields. Furthermore, I checked the accessibility of all four HTML activities with WAVE AIM, and I validated the HTML code using W3C Markup Validation.
